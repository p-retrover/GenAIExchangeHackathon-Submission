    For millions of students across India, choosing a career path feels like standing at a daunting crossroads with a thousand branching paths and no map. They are inundated with generic advice but starved for guidance that speaks to their unique skills and dreams.
  \end{block}
  \begin{alertblock}{The Consequence}
    This leads to decision paralysis, missed opportunities, and a generation of talent struggling to find their place. Students need a trusted co-pilot for their career journey.
