            <h2>The Challenge: Navigating the Career Maze</h2>
            <p>For millions of students across India, choosing a career path feels like standing at a daunting crossroads with a thousand branching paths and no map.

This leads to decision paralysis, missed opportunities, and a generation of talent struggling to find their place.</p>
            <p>Students need more than just a list of jobs; they need a trusted co-pilot for their career journey.</p>
